# Discount Corner
**This web application uses OPAL's policy authentication and authorization feature to let users access discounts based on their membership and purchase history.
It uses git webhook to deliver payloads to the OPAL server, which changes website's discounted items dynamically.**

## Features
- Classification and authentication using user's data.
- User's membership and purchase history authorizes him/her to specific discounts.
  - Membership holders will get a full discount on all the items on the website.
  - Users without membership will get discounts based on their purchase history.
- Uses git webhook to track committed changes in the policy repo.

These are the steps required to install and run the Discount Access Manager ü§ë project:

1. Clone the repository and change the current directory to the cloned repository:

```

2. Run the docker-compose.yml: *(If you have Docker Hub installed, KUDOS!)*
```docker

```

3. For policy-making changes, fork `https://github.com/piyushk2001/Discount_Access_PolicyOPAL.git` and pass it to `OPAL_POLICY_REPO_URL` in the opal-server environment inside `docker-compose.yml`.

4. Head over to the running opal-server container in Docker Hub and generate a webhook secret key using its **Exec CL:** `opal-server generate-secret` and pass it to `OPAL_POLICY_REPO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in the opal-server environment inside `docker-compose.yml`.
